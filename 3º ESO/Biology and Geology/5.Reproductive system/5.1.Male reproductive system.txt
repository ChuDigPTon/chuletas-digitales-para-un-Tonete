**PARTS**

*Penis*
Formed of erectile tissue, which has small cavities that fill with blood to cause erection.
It is formed of 2 corpora cavernosa and one corpus spongiosum.
The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra to keep it open.
The glans is covered by the foreskin when the penis is not erect.

*Testicles*
2 oval-shaped organs hanging outside the abdominal cavity (they need 3ºC to produce sperm). They are surrounded by the scrotum.
They are formed of lobules. Each one has millions of seminiferous tubules.
The walls of the seminiferous tubules have sperm precursor cells and Sertoli cells.
There are other endocrine cells that produce androgens (testosterone).

*Genital tract*
Epididymis: long coiled tube at the top of each testicle that stores sperm. Each seminiferous tubule come to this tube.
Urethra: tube that expels semen and urine. It is shared between the reproductive and urinary systems.
Vas deferens: tube that passes through the prostate and ends in the urethra. Secretions from accesory glands empty here.

*Accesory glands*
Seminal vesicles: glands behind the bladder. They produce the seminal fluid, which contains fructose, the main energy source of the sperm.
Prostate gland: gland underneath the bladder. It produces prostatic fluid, which neutralises the acidity of female mucosa.
Cowper's gland: gland at the base of the penis. It produces lubricating fluid, which neutralises the acidity of the urethra.

**SPERMATOGENESIS**

It takes place in the walls of the seminiferous tubule. It starts in the puberty. It is marked by the first ejaculation (spermarche).

*Phases*
1) Multiplication: the spermatogonia divides to form new spermatogonia.
2) Growth: some spermatogonia become bigger and divide into 2 spermatocyte each.
3) Maturation: the spermatocytes divide to form 4 spermatids each.
4) Differentiation: the spermatids differentiate into sperm.

*Sperm*
Consists of 3 parts:
-Head: it contains the nucleus, with its 23 chromosomes. It has the acrososme, which produces enzymes that dissolve the ovule's outer layer.
-Midpiece: it contains several mitochondria.
-Tail: moves thanks to the energy produced by the mitochondria.
