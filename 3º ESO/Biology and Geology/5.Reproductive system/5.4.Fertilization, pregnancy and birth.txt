**FERTILIZATION**
It is the fusion of 2 gametes: the male sperm and the female ovum.
It happens in the fallopian tubes (internal fertilization).
The ovum can survive for 1-2 days, while the sperm can survive for 72 hours, therefore, the ferile perios starts 3 days before and after ovulation.
It is divided into 5 phases:

*Approximation of gametes*
The erect penis is inserted into the vagina. The penis ejaculates, releasing semen (around 300 million in one ejaculation).
The sperm move in the female reproductive system to the ovum. There are barriers that kill most of the sperm (mucosa of cervix, acidity of vagina, immune system, cilia of the fallopian tubes)

*Fusion of gametes*
The sperm releases enzymes from its acrosome to penetrate the ovum's membranes.
After one sperm comes into contact with the oocyte, it differentiates into a ovum and releases a ferilization membrane that prevents more sperm from coming.
The nucleus of the sperm and ovum fise together to form the zygote.

*Development of the embryo*
The zygote forms a mass of cells called the morula and then the embryo.
The embryo receives nutrients from the vitellus.

*Implantation*
The embryo penetrates into the endometrium. The nutrients of the vitellus are quickly exhausted here.

*Placentation*
New structures are formed to guarantee the survival of the embryo.
-Amnoitic sac: membrane full of amniotic fluid that surround and protects the embryo/foetus. It also stops it from drying out.
-Umbilical cord: it connects the placenta and the embryo/foetus. It has 2 arteries and 1 vein. It transports nutrients and waste products.
-Placenta: it connects the embryo/foetus with the mother. It is in charge of the functions of respiration, nutrition and excretion.


**PREGNANCY**
It begins after implantation and finishes at birth. It has a duration of 40 weeks and it is divided into 3 trimesters.

*First trimester*
The internal organs are formed.
The embryo now becomes a foetus, which has a human appearance.
The foetus is 10 cm long and weights 50-80 g.

*Second trimester*
The excretory, circulatory and nervous systems maturate.
The foetus moves in response to stimuli.
The foetus is about 30 cm long and weights 1 kg.

*Third trimester*
All organs mature.
The foetus' head is in the birth canal.
The foetus is 50 cm long and weights 2,5-4 kg.


**BIRTH**
Also called labour. It consists of 3 phases:

*Dilation*
The vagina and cervix start to dilate and the uterus contracts to push the baby.
The amniotic sac breaks and the fluid flows out.
This has a duration of 12 hours.

*Delivery of the baby*
The vagina and the cervix are fully dilated and the contractions push the baby out.
The umbilical cord is cut and the baby is made to cry.
This has duration of 30 minutes.

*Delivery of the placenta*
15-30 minutes after the delivery of the baby, the contractions push out the placenta, umbilical cord and the remains of the endometrium.
