The menstrual cycle begins in the puberty and continues until menopause.
Each cycle has a duration of 28 days.
The changes are controlled by a series of hormones produced by the pituitary gland (LH, FSH) and the ovaries (oestrogens and progesterone). The pituitary gland is stimulated by the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRh), which is produced by the hypothalamus.
The menstrual cycle is divided into:

**OVARIAN CYCLE**
Changes produced in the ovaries. It is divided into 3 phases:

*Follicular phase*
Days 1-14
The pituitary gland releases folliclestimulating hormones (FSH), which cause the follicle and its oocyte to maturate.
The follicle starts producing oestrogens.

*Ovulation*
Day 14
The pituitary gland releases luteinising hormones (LH).
The LH, FSH and ostrogens levels are at the highest, causing the follicle to release the oocyte.
The woman is fertile.

*Luteal phase*
Days 15-28
The follicle transforms into a corpus luteum, which starts to produce progesterone.
If fertilisation has not taken place, the woman has a period.


**UTERINE CYCLE**
Changes produced in the endometrium. It is divided into 3 phases:

*Menstruation*
Days 1-5/7
If fertilisation has not taken place in the previous cycle, the woman has a period.
The corpus luteum breaks down into a corpus albicans, and stops producing progesterone.
As a consequence, the endometrium breaks away.

*Proliferative phase*
Days 5/7-14 (After menstruation and until ovulation)
The oestrogens produced by the follicle cause the endometrium to thicken.

*Secretory phase*
Days 15-28 (After ovulation and until menstruation)
The progesterone produced by the copur luteum cause the maximum thickening of the endometrium to prepare for a possible implantation.
If ferilisation takes place, the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) informs the brain not to break the endometrium. This hormone also transports nutrients to the embryo/foetus.
