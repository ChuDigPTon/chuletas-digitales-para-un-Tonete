**PARTS**

*External genitalia*
They form the vulva. It is formed of 2 parts: the labia majora (thicker) and the labia minora (thinner). The clitoris is a sensitive area near the top of the labia minora.

*Ovaries*
2 almond-shaped organs suspended in the abdominal cavity by small ligaments. They have a medulla (inside) and a cortex (external), which contains follicles.
The follicles produce hormones (oestrogens & progesterone) and oocytes. When the follicle releases its oocyte, it breaks down into a corpus luteum.

*Genital tract*
Uterus: hollow muscular organ with a narrow section at the bottom (cervix) which connects the uterus to the vagina. 
  -The wall is formed of a layer of smooth muscle tissue (myometrium). 
  -The endometrium lines the inside. It has many blood vessels.
Fallopian tubes: they connect the ovaries and the uterus. The wider section connected to the ovaries are called infundibulum, which collect the oocytes.
Vagina: It connects the uterus with the outside. 
  -There are glands which produce lubricants that help during sexual intercourse. 
  -The hymen covers partially the vagina.

**OOGENESIS**

The formation of the ovule starts before birth, and it stops at the oocyte phase. It continues during puberty (marked by the first menstruation, menarche) until menopause.

*Phases*
1) Multiplication: the oogonium divides to form more oogonia.
2) Growth: the oogonium becomes larger and divides into 4 primary oocytes.
3) Maturation: the primary oocyte divides into a secondary oocyte and 3 polar bodies, which disappear.
4) Differentiation: the secondary oocyte becomes and ovule. This only happens when the oocyte is fertilised.

*Ovule*
It is large because it contains nutrients in its vitellus. 
They are covered by the vitelline membrane or plasma membrane.
They are also protected by the zona pellucida and the corona radiata (formed of remains of follicular cells).
