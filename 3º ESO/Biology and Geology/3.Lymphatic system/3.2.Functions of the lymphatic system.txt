*Absorption of fats*
Fats are absorbed by the intestinal villi and they go into the lacteals. The lacteals then transport the fats to the lymphatic system and then to the subcalvian vein.

*Defense*
The lymphatic system is strongly linked to immunity (many of its organs produce defense cells)
The lymph nodes store and produce white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes)

*Interstitial fluid drainage*
The blood capillaries filter out its components.
The interstitial fluid is contains water, glucose, fatty acids, aminoacids, vitamins and hormones.
The water and glucose need to the blood: they are collected by the lymph capillaries that transport them to the bloodstream.
