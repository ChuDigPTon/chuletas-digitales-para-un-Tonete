*Lymph*
It is a colorless liquid formed of blood plasma and interstitial fluid.
It contains fats, proteins, white blood cells, cell fragments and microorganisms that are eliminated.
The lymph is moved by contractions of skeletal muscles.

*Lymph vessels*
Narrow tubes by which lymph flows. They have valves to prevent the lymph from flowing backwards.
They join together to form bigger vessels. The main vessels are the thoracid duct (which begins in a dilated sac called the cysterna chyli) and the right lymphatic duct.
All lymph vessels end in subclavian vein, near the heart, to release their contents into the blood.

*Lymph nodes*
They are formed of a internal network of fibres. 
They are connected by the lymph vessels.
They produce white blood cells.

*Tonsils*
Formed of large lymphatic nodules.
They are located in the mucous membrane (oral and pharyngeal cavities)

*Thymus*
Gland located behind the sternum.
T-cells are stored here until their maturation.

*Spleen*
Largest lymphatic organ. It is located between the stomach and the diaphragm.
It filters and stores blood.

*Bone marrow*
Semi-solid tissue.
-Red bone marrow: located in the cancellous or spongy bone tissue. It produces blood cells.
-Yellow bone marros: located in hollow spaces of long bones. It stores fat.
