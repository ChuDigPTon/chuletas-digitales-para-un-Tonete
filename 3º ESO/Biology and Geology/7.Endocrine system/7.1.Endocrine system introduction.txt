**COORDINATION AND CONTROL**

*Nerve information*
It is transmitted by nerve impulses and neurotransmitters.
It is released in the synapse.
It transmits a fast response that last a short time.

**Endocrine information**
It is transmitted by hormones.
It is released in the blood.
It transmits a slower response that lasts longer.


**HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY AXIS**
It is formed of:

*Hypothalamus*
Located at the base of the brain. It has a neurosecretory function (belongs to nervous and endocrine systems).
It releases hypothalamus releasing hormones.

*Pituitary gland or hypophysis*
Connected to the hypothalamus.
It is stimulated by the hypothalamus releasing hormones to release pituitary hormones.

*Target organ*
It is stimulated by the pituitary hormones to perform its function.
They are normally endocrine glands that secret more hormones. When enough hormones are released, they act on the hypothalamus to prevent more hormones.
