*PITUITARY GLAND*
Secretes:
	-FSH (folliclestimulating hormone): stimulates the follicles (female) and the sperm production (male).
	-LH (luteinising hormone): causes ovulation and stimulates the corpus luteum (female) and the androgen production (male).
	-TSH (thyrotropin): stimulates the thyroid gland.
	-GH (growth hormone): stimulates the growth and lengthening of the bones. 
	-LTH (prolactin): stimulates the mammary glands.
	-ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone): stimulates adrenal glands.
	-Vasopressin: stimulates the reabsorption of water in the kidneys.
	-Oxytocin: controld the uterine contractions during labour.
	
	
*THYROID AND PARATHYROID*
The thyroid secretes:
	-Thyroxine: controls cell metabolism and development.
	-Calcitonin: reduces blood calcium levels (bone growth).
The parathyroid secretes parathormone, which increases blood calcium levels (bone renewal).


*PANCREAS*
Secretes:
	-Insulin: reduces blood glucose levels.
	-Glucagon: increases blood glucose levels.


*THYMUS*
Mainly active during puberty. It then shrinks and is partially replaced by fat.
It plays an important role in defense: it secretes thymosin, which stimulates the development of T-cells.


*ADRENAL GLANDS*
Secretes:
	-Adrenaline and ther sympathetic neurotransmitters: it activates the sympathetic nervous system. It is released in the medulla.
	-Corticotropin: anti-inflamatory effect. It also controls the metabolism of minerals salts and carbohydrates. It is released in the cortex.
	
	
*OVARIES*
Secretes:
	-Progesterone: controls the menstrual cycle.
	-Oestrogens: controls the female sex characteristics and the menstrual cycle.
	

*TESTICLES*
Secretes androgens, responsible of male sex characteristics.


*PINEAL GLAND*
It releases melatonin, which controls the cycles of sleep, rest, activity, menstrual cycles and heart rhythms.
