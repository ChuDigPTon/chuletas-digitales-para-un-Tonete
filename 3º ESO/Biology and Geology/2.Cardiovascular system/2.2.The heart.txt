The heart is a hollow, muscular organ with the size of a fist that pumps the blood.

*Layers*
Endocardium: internal epithelial tissue, continuation of the endothelium.
Myocardium: middle and thickest layer. Formed of cardiac muscle tissue (strong involuntary contractions).
Pericardium: external layer. Has a double membrane. The space between them is called pericardial space.

*Chambers*
The atria (2 upper chambers) have thin walls and blood flows from veins to them.
The ventricles (2 lower chambers) have thicker walls (the left is the thickest because it is connected to the aorta and its pump has to be stronger) and blood flows from them to the arteries.
The left and the right side is separated by the interventricular septum.

*Blood vessels*
Arteries: the aorta takes blood to the rest of the body (from left ventricle), the pulmonary artery takes blood to the lungs (from right ventricle).
Veins: the vena cavae (up and down) take blood to the right atrium (from the rest of the body's veins), the pulmonary veins (2 for each lung) take blood to the left atrium (from the lungs).
The coronary arteries and veins provide the heart with nutrients and oxygen.

*Valves*
Their function is to prevent blood from flowing backwards.
Atrioventricular valves (located between the atria and the ventricles): Tricuspid valve in the right and mitral (also called bicuspid) in the left.
Semilunar or arterial valves (located between the ventricles and the arteries): Pulmonary valve in the right and aortic in the left.
