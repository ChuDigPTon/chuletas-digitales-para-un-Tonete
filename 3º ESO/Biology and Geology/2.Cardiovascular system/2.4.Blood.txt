Blood is formed of:

*Plasma (55%)*
Yellowish fluid formed mainly of water that contains all blood components.
It is composed of blood serum and fibrinogen (protein involved in blood clotting).

*Red blood cells (45%)*
Also called erythrocytes. They are flat, round cells that do not have a nucleus.
They contain haemoglobin, a protein that contains iron and transports oxygen. It gives the blood its color.

*White blood cells (<1%)*
Also called leukocytes. They have a defensive function. There are 2 types:
-Granulocytes: they have granules in their cytoplasm and lobes in their nucleus.
-Agranulocytes: they have not granules in their cytoplasm or lobes in their nucleus. The lymphocytes produce antibodies while the monocytes defend the bosy by phagocytosing.

*Platelets (<1%)*
Fragments of cells (they are not cells) produced in the bone marrow.
They are essential in blood clotting.

*Other*
Nutrients, hormones, ions, and metabolic waste.
