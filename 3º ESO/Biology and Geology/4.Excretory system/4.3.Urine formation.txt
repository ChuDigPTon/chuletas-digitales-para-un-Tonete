Urine is a clear, yellowish liquid formed of water (95%), urea, uric acid, potassium, sodium, phosphate and creatinine.
Urine formation is divided in 3 stages:

*Filtration*
Blood reaches the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole and substances are filtered out.
Unfiltered substances leave the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole.

*Absorption*
Some substances are returned to the blood (peritubular capillaries).
Glucose and aminoacids return from the proximal concoluted tubule.
Water returns from the descending Loop of Henle and mineral salts from the ascending Loop of Henle.

*Secretion*
Some substances (potassium ions) pass from the blood to the final part of the nephron.
Urine is formed and it flows to the urinary bladder via the collecting duct and ureters.
