*Nephrons*
Structural, functional units that form the kidneys. There are about 1.000.000 in each kidney.
They are surrounded by a network of capillaries called the peritubular capillaries.
They filter blood and produce urine.
A nephron consists of the following parts:
-Bowman's capsule: cup shaped sac that contains the glomerulus (capillaries). It is inside the renal cortex.
-Proximal convoluted tubule: twisted tube that connects the Bowman's capsule and the Loop of Henle. It is inside the renal cortex.
-Loop of Henle: U-shaped tube that connects the proximal convoluted tubule with the distal convoluted tubule. It reaches the medulla.
-Distal convoluted tubule: twited tube that connects the Loop of Henle with the collecting duct. It is inside the renal cortex.
-Collecting duct: takes the urine to the ureters. It reaches the medulla.

*Kidneys*
Bean-shaped organs of about 15 cm long, they are surrounded by a thick layer of fat.
There is an adrenal gland on top of each kidney.
The renal artery take blood to the concave side, the renal vein takes blood from the concave side, and the ureters take the urine from its concave side.
Layers:
-Cortex: rough outer layer
-Medulla: striated middle layer. It id divided into renal pyramids or Malpighi's pyramids.
-Renal pelvis: innermost structure. It is connected to the ureter.

*Ureters*
Narrow tubes of about 25 cm long by which urine flows.

*Urinary bladder*
Expandable, muscular oragn that stores urine (up to half a litre).
When it is full, urination happens. There are receptors that monitor pressure and the increase in volume.

*Urethra*
Tube by which urine flows to the outside of the body.
