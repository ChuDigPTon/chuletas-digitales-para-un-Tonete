A synapse is the process by which a nerve impulse is transmitted.
A nerve impulse travel in one direction (dendrites, soma axon), in form of an electric current and they are generated by an excited neuron.

*Types*
-Electrical: the membranes of both neurons is close enough for the nerve impulse to pass directly to the second neuron. This allows the impulse to travel faster.
-Chemical: the transmission of the impulse is done with chemical intermediators called neurotransmitters. They are more common.

*Parts*
-Presynaptic terminal: end of the axon of the first neuron. It contains synaptic vesicles that contain neurotransmitters.
-Synaptic left: small space between neurons.
-Postsypatic terminal: dendrites or soma of the second neuron. There are receptors that bind to the neurotransmitters.

*Process*
The nerve impulse reaches the presynaptic terminal and triggers the vesicles.
The vesicles release the neurotransmitters which pass through the cleft and bind to the receptors.
This causes a new nerve impulse to be generated, which travels through the soma aand axon to another neuron.
