**NERVES**
The peripheral nervous system is formed of nerves and nerve ganglia.
-Nerve: group of axons with their myelin sheath and covered of connective tissue. There are several types:
  -According to location:
	-Cranial nerves: emerge in pairs from the brain.
	-Spinal nerves: emerge in pairs from the spinal cord
  -According to the information transmitted:
	-Sensory: transmit sensort information.
	-Motor: transmit motor information.
	-Mixed: transmit both types of information.

-Nerve ganglion: cluster of somas distributed thoughout the nerves.


**PARTS**

*Somatic*
Formed of nerves that connect the nerve centres with sensory and motor nerves.
It controls voluntary acts and reflexes.

*Autonomic*
Formed of nerves in the smooth muscle in the gut, cardiac muscle, blood vessels and glands.
It regulates the autonomic functions that keep us alive.
It is formed of:
	-Parasympathetic nervous system: associated with situations of rest and calm. It is usually active at night. It decreases energy expediture
	-Sympathetic nervous system: associated with emergency situations (fight-or-flight). It increases energy expediture.
