There are 2 types:

**NEURONS**
Highly specialised cells that cannot divide. They transmit nerve impulses. Each neuron consists of:
-Soma: the cell's life support center. It contains the nucleus and most of the cytoplasm.
-Dendrites: short branched projections that receive nerve impulses.
-Axon: long branched projection that transmits nerve impulses. There is usually one. It is also called nerve fibre.


**NEUROGLIA**
They are located between neurons. They protect, nourish and support neurons. The main types are:

-Astrocytes: star-shaped cell that connects neurons with capillaries. They are support cells that control the chemical environment around neurons, give them nutrients, and remove neurotransmitters.
-Oligodendrocytes: cells that wrap around axons in the central nervous system.
-Schwann cells: cells that wrap around axons in the peripheral nervous system.

Oligodendrocytes and schwann cells form the myelin sheath, an insulating layer whose function is the fast and efficient transmission of nerve impulses.
