The central nervous system is responsible for higher cognitive functions and general sensory integration and coordination.
It consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

**AT MICROSCOPIC LEVEL**
It is formed of:
  -White matter: group of axons covered by the myelin sheath.
  -Grey matter: group of somas and dendrites.

**DEFENSES**
It is protected by:
  -Skull
  -Spinal column
  -Meninges: protective layers of connective tissue. There are 3 layers:
	-Pia mater: inner layer.
	-Arachnoid mater: middle network of fibres.
	-Dura mater: outer layer.
	*The arachnoid and pia mater are surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, a liquid that cushions the brain and spinal column, protecting from impact.

**BRAIN**
Formed of:

*Cerebrum*
It has 2 hemispheres, separated by a longitudinal fissure. They are connected by the corpus collosum (White matter).

*Cerebral cortex*
Grey matter that surrounds the cerebrum. 
Its functions are: mental and intellectual, voluntary movement, receiving and interpretating sensory information and regulating the nervous system.

*Limbic system*
Formed of glands. They regulate the endocrine system and are responsible for emotions, feelings and basic insticts. It is formed of:
  -Hypothalamus: connected to the pituitary gland
  -Epithalamus: contains the pineal gland/epiphysis cerebri
  -Thalamus

*Cerebellum*
Located at the back of the brain. It is responsible for motor coordination and balance. It if formed of:
  -Cerebellar cortex: grey matter outside.
  -Arbor vitae: branched white matter inside.

*Brain stem*
Located at the base of the brain. It regulates the autonomic functions that keeps us alive. The white matter is outside and the grey matter is in the inside.


**SPINAL CORD**
Formed of vertebrae.

*Functions*
-Conduit: it connects the brain with the sense and effector organs.
-Reflex: involuntary movements in dangerous situations.

*Parts*
-Central canal: full of cerebrospinal fluid.
-Grey matter: inside
-White matter: outside
-Sensory/dorsal root: nerve that transmit sensory information.
-Dorsal/posterior horns: thin, star-shaped that connect to the sensory root.
-Spinal ganglion: cluster of somas in the sensory branch.
-Motor/ventral root: nerve that transmits motor information.
-Ventral/anterior horns: thick sections connected to the motor root.
