# Similarity between chromosomes and genes
- Individuals have both of them in 2 versions (father and mother).
- When the gametes are formed, both are separated and distributed randomly.
- When fertilization occurs, 1 allele combines with another. The same happens with chromosomes.

# Thomas Hunt Morgan
He performed experiments on the location of genes.

## Gene linkage
It is a phenomenon that consists on the tendency of alleles on the same chromosome to be inherited together.  
The genes inherited together are called linkage groups. Their number matches the haploid number.

## Recombinant and crossing over
Frequently, linkage groups act as if they were not linked.  
This is because they are combined (recombination).  
It is related to the crossing over during meiosis, in which fragments of chromosomes (alleles are exchanged).

# Ideas of the theory
- Genes are found in chromosomes.
- Genes are ordered in a linear fashion.
- The recombination of genes is the result of the crossing over during meiosis.
