# Principles
- The cell is the structural unit of life, as all living things are composed of cells.
- The cell is the reproductive unit of life, as all cells come from pre-existing cells.
- The cell is the functional unit of life, as all cells perform the vital functions.

# Main scientists involved
- Zacharias Jansen (17th): invented the first microscope.
- Anton van Leeuwenhoek (17th): designed his own microscope and used it to observe 'animalcules' (bacteria, protozoa, algae and yeast)
- Robert Hooke (17th): observed cell walls in a piece of cork, thus giving them their name.
- Theodor Schwann (19th): discovered that animals are made up of cells.
- Matthias Schleiden (19th): discovered that plants are made up of cells.
    - Schwann and Schleiden contributed to develop the cell theory.
- Rudolf Virchow (20th): continued the cell theory by proving that cells reproduce.
- Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal (20th): stated that the nervous tissue is also made up of cells.
