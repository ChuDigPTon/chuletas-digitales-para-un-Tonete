# According to number of cells
- Unicellular: the whole organism is the cell.
- Multicellular: it is formed of 2 or more cells.

# Types of cell
- Prokaryotic: they are usually smaller and simpler, have a nucleoid and lack membranous organelles.
- Eukaryotic: they are usually bigger and more complex, have a true nucleus and have several membranous organelles.

# The Endosymbiotic theory
Developed by Lynn Margulis. States that eukaryotic cells come from big prokaryotic cells that engulfed aerobic and photosynthetic cells.  
Those cells became the mitochondria and the chloroplast, which have a symbiotic relationship with the cell.
