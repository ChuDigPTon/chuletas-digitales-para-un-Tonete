# According to number of cells
- Unicellular: the whole organism is the cell.
- Multicellular: it is formed of 2 or more cells.

# Types of cell
- Prokaryotic: they are usually smaller and simpler, have a nucleiod and lack membraneous organelles.
- Eukaryotic: they are usually bigger and more complex, have a true nucleus and have several membraneous organelles.

# The Endosymbiotic theory
Developed by Lynn Margulis. States that eukaryotic cells come from big prokaryotic cells that engulfed aerobic and photosynthetic cells.  
Those cells became the mitochondria and the chloropast, which have a symbiotic relationship with the cell.
