# German Confederation
Germany did not exist until the 19th century.  
Its territories were previously occupied by the Holy Roman Empire, however it was dismantled by Napoleon Bonaparte.  
The Congress of Vienna then created the German Confederation, formed of 39 states:
- Austria: empire that had a strong presence in the east.
- Prussia: kingdom that unified Germany. It had a strong military and political presence.
- Denmark
- Bavaria: kingdom at the south.
- Many small territories governed by princes.

# Zollverein
Also called the Custom Union (1834).  
It was a commercial union led by Prussia that excluded Austria.  
It consisted of a single railway network. It promoted economic development and encouraged the middle class to support the unification.

# Otto von Bismarck
Prussian chancellor under the reign of William I that led the unification in an authoritarian way:
- He allied with Austria and declared war to Denmark (1864) for Schleswig and Holstein. This caused disagreements for the control of these territories.
- He then defeated the Austrians in the Battle of Sadowa (1866), gaining full control on the territories.
- He planned to annex Alsace and Lorraine, 2 German-speaking French territories. To do that, he defeated the French in the Battle of Sedan (1870) and occupied Paris. This caused more conflicts in the Great War.
After all of that, the Second Reich (Second German Empire) was declared in 1871.
