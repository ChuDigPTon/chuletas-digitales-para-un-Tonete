# Unification
Italians felt to be part of a cultural and historical unit, but they were split in several territories.  
Piedmont played a key role in the unification. Victor Emmanuel II governed with a parliament whose democratic was against Austria. As a result, the Prime Minister, Count of Cavour made an alliance with Napoleon III against Austria. They defeated the Austrians in the battles of Magenta and Solferino. Italians then defeated the French, gaining full control of the north of Italy.  
Nationalist revolutionary Garibaldi occupied and annexed Naples and Sicily to Piedmont.  
After the Capture of Rome, Pope Pius IX was imprisoned in the Vatican city.  
Finally, a moderate political regime (a constitutional monarchy) was declared in the form of Italy. Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy was crowned king in 1870.
