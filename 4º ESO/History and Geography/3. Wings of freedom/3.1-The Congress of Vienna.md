# Introduction
Napoleon was defeated in the battle of Waterloo (1815) and exiled to the island of Saint Helena.
The victorious countries met in the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815).
England was a parliamentary monarchy while Austria, Prussia and Russia were absolutist.

# Decisions taken
They restored absolutism:
- Legitimism: only kings had the legitimacy to govern.
- Old dynasties restored. Louis XVIII (Bourbon) was the king in France.
- Treaty of the Holy Alliance: absolutist countries proposed to help each other against liberal rebellions or uprisings.
They changed the territorial distribution based on the balance of power:
- Piedmont-Sardinia was created at the north-west of Italy. It gained Nice and Savoy. It controlled France's expansion.
- The Netherlands (Holland and Belgium) was also created to control France's expansion.
- France returned to its pre-Napoleonic boundaries. It lost Savoy and Nice.
- Germany remained divided into many territories. It was known as the German Confederation.
- The east had many different languages and religions, that will lead to conflicts. It was divided into:
-- Austria: empire that had strong control in Germany and Italy.
-- Russia: empire.
-- Turkey: empire.
-- Prussia: kingdom that had strong control in Germany.
