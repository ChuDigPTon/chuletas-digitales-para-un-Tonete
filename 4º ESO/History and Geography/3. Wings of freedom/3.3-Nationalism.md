Nationalism is a system that believes in the superiority of a nation over others.
It emerged in the 19th century.
Nationalists demanded the creation of new nations and their right to become a state.

# Nation
It is used to refer a group of inhabitants who had a common:
- Ethnicity (cultural tradition)
- Language
- Mentality
- Customs

# Causes
- Napoleon Bonaparte and the Congress of Vienna redistributed the territories for their own interest. The people felt that their territories were being occupied by others. Most of the occupying regimes were absolutist, which led nationalists to be liberal too.
- The Romantic culture marked the sense of belonging to a people as an important human feeling, making nationalism an important sentiment. Legends and myths about their origins became important.
- The economy and industrialization also had importance. The rich classes became nationalists and stated that national unity was needed to create a common economic policy (to exploit other territories).

# Types
- Unifying nationalism: consisted of the creation of a new state for people with a common past and culture (even if the political regime was different). This was the case of Germany and Italy in Europe.
- Dividing nationalism: consisted of the independence of territories forced to be part of a bigger unit. This was the case of the Slavs in the Ottoman Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empires in Europe.
