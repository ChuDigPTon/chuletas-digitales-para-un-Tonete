*Definition*
The Enlightenment is a cultural, philosophical and political movement characterized by:
--Rationalization.
--Anthropocentrism.
--The focus on happiness.
--Freedom.
--Criticism of the Old Regime (specially absolutism and Church's orthodoxy).
It first took place in France and it spread to Europe and America during the 18th and 19th century.
It involved the rise of the wealthy middle class (bourgeoisie) to the political power, as most thinkers came from there.
The period is known as the Age of Enlightenment.
The way of thinking was "If it is not practical/does not make sense, it is not useful and should be dismissed"

*The Old Regime*
It was the political and social system that liberal thinkers replaced in the 18th century. 
It was common between the 14th and 17th centuries.
Characteristics:
--Absolutism/authoritarianism.
--Class society.
--Subsistence economy based on agriculture.

*Characteristics*
One of the main features of Elightenment was the focus on happiness and a happy existence on Earth (anthropocentrism). For that, a series of basic needs had to be met.

Reason: the population needed to be critical and be able to think by themselves. For that, superstitions and beliefs were left aside.
Freedom: this included freedom of the press and thought. The population needed a set of individual rights to have a happy life.
Progress: scientific and technical advances are needed to make people's lives easier and happier.
Education: if people have a basic education, they will take better decisions and will think better.
--Enlightened thinkers wanted the education to be compulsory, free and controlled by the state, ending with Church's monopoly.
Tolerance: to have a critical society, there must be a coexistence of ideas.
Secularization: the Church should not have influence on political decisions, as they should not dictate the moral values of the people, so it was separated from the government.
