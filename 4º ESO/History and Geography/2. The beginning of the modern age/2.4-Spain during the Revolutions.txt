**Reign of Carlos IV (1788-1808)**

Most of the decisions were taken by his minister, Godoy.
His reign initially continued the reforms made by the Bourbons, but when the French Revolution took place, his government panicked and suppresed all revolutionary thoughts with the Inquisition.
When his cousin Louis XVI was executed, Carlos IV sent troops to fight the National Convention, but he was defeated.

*Napoleon Bonaparte*
When he came to power (1799), Godoy continued the tradition of Pactos de Familia and allied with France against Great Britain.
Spain and France created the Continental Blockade, but both were defeated in the Battle of Trafalgar (1805).
Godoy and Bonaparte signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807), which allowed French troops to cross Spain to invade Portugal, an ally of England.
--Bonaparte's plan was to make his troops reach Spain and invade the country.

*Fernando*
The heir of Carlos, Fernando, was against Godoy, and organized an uprising against his father, the Motín de Aranjuez (March 1808).
--Godoy almost lost his life and Carlos IV was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, now Fernando VI.

*José de Bonaparte*
Napoleon used the incident to make Carlos and Fernando their prisoners in Bayonna.
Abdicaciones de Bayonna: He forced both to abdicate in favour of him, and he abdicated to his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, who is now José I of Spain.
Estatuto de Bayonna: Napoleon tried to legitimize the reign of his brother by granting Spain some of the rights from his civil code. However, José did not manage to get the support of most of the spanish population.


**Peninsular War (1808-1814)**

The people of Madrid started an uprising on 2nd May 1808, which led to the Fusilamientos del 3 de mayo.
The uprising was defeated, but it spread to other parts of Spain.
The war was organized by the Juntas de Defensa (in the main provinces). The Junta Central was created as the government.
The French army was too powerful for the Spanish people.
--They had to rely on forming guerrillas, a military tactic based on using the knowledge of the terrain to make surprise attacks, weakening the enemy.
--The Junta Central had to ally with England, which sent troops to the Peninsula to fight the French army.
Finally, the French troops left Spain. Napoleon signed the Treaty of Valençay, which recognized Fernando VI as the king of Spain.


**Cortes de Cádiz**

The Junta Central met in Sevilla and held elections to create the first Parliament (Cortes Generales, 1809).
In 1810, the representatives met in the only place not under French control, the city of Cádiz, declared national sovereignty and started to draft a constitution.
