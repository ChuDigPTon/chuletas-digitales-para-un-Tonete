In the 18th century, France was still under an absolutist king, Louis XVI.

**Causes**

Liberal ideas: some thinkers started to criticize absolutism and class society. They started to advocate for equality before the law and separation of powers..
Economic crisis: the 7 Years' War affected severely the economy of France and it had to pay an enourmous public debt. The money of the nobility was still spent on luxuries.
--Subsistence crisis: due to bad harvests. Most of the population could barely afford food and the Treasury could not impose heavier taxes.
Inequality before the law: the first and second estate did not pay taxes, and they did not generate any benefit for the nation's economy.
The example of the United States: some French fought with the colonists in the American Revolution War, and some delegates who signed the Constitution (Jefferson and Franklin) visited France frequently.


**Phases**

*Estates-General (1789)*
Louis XVI called a consulative assembly in the palace of Versailles with the representatives of each estate to decide if the nobility should pay taxes or not.
There was political unrest in France. Pamphlets and books (>25000) criticizing the Old Regime were distributed.
The representatives of the Third Estate (90% of population) wanted the votes to be counted by head, instead of by estate. The first and second estates denied, reaching an impasse.
The representaives of the Third Estate left the assembly, proclaimed themselves the true representatives of the nation, created the National Assembly and swore not to depart until France had a Constitution.

*National Constituent Assembly (1789-1791)*
After the creation of the National Assembly and fearing its dissolution by the king, the people of Paris stormed the Bastille prison (for weapons).
The guards opened the doors and the Bastille prison (symbol of absolutism) was assaulted.
The king failed to dissolve the National Assembly, and it took important decisions:
--The French Constitution of 1791.
--The Declaration of the Rights of Men and Citizens.
--Abolishing of feudal privileges.

*Legislative Assembly (1791-1792)*
Absolutist countries Austria and Prussia threatened to invade France to stop the revolution.
The National Assembly was divided into 2 groups:
--Jacobins: radicals who wanted a republic.
--Girondins: moderates who wanted a constitutional monarchy.

*The Republic (1792-1795)*
France got involved in several wars against european absolutist kingdoms.
The National Assembly declared the republic, which took control of the legislative power. Louis XVI was tried for treason and executed by guillotine.
The Comitee of Public Safety took control of the executive power, under the leadership of Roberspierre, and executed anyone suspected of being antirrevolutionary. This period is known as the Terror.

*The Directory (1795-1799)*
Roberspierre was executed by moderates, and the Directory was created, which was formed of 5 directors.
Meanwhile, France was still involved in wars. Important battles were won over absolutist powers.

*The Consulate (1799-1804)*
The most important militar general, Napoleon Bonaparte, led a coup and took power, appointing himself as Consul.
